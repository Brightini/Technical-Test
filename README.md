# Technical Test

This is a solution to a technical test, conducted by Learnable. It involves writing a function, nth_most_rate(list: list, n: int) that determines and returns the nth rarest item in a list of integers. Where `list` is a list of parameters and `n` is the nth rarest term and it cannot be 0 or greater than the number of items in the list.

### Example
```python
nth_most_rate([5,4,5,4,5,4,4,5,3,3,3,2,2,1,5], 2)
# the 2nd rarest term in this list will be 2
# the 3rd rarest term in this list will be 3
# ... and so forth
```
